2.20 RAW VS  COOKED
Presence of nutrients does not necessarily mean that they will be digested and absorbed by the body. Some nutrients, like water soluble vitamins are destroyed when cooked but others are enhanced or more easily absorbed when cooked. So it is inappropriate to make a blanket statement. For example raw spinach has three times more vitamin C but cooked spinach offers more calcium and minerals. Cooking can enhance availability of certain nutrients like iron, magnesium,  Zinc and calcium. 
Most foods that can be eaten raw should be consumed that way and when cooked, cook them for a short duration. 
1. Fruits should be eaten raw as whole food. 
2. Green leafy vegetables should be eaten raw as salad or boiled or as smoothies or juice. 
3. Many greens can be stuffed inside rotis or blended in dough. For example Bathua, Methi, Spinach work well this way. Of course we all know about stuffing roti with potatoes, cauliflower and muli. 
4. If you mix avocado in atta, the rotis come out very soft because avocado is 77% fat. 
5. Nuts and seeds should be eaten raw or roasted but not fried. 
6. Some vegetables like mushrooms and tomatoes, asparagus, pumpkin, are better cooked than raw. 
7. Starchy vegetables should be eaten cooked.
8. Fresh beans can be eaten raw or cooked. 
9. All grains and legumes and dried beans that can be sprouted are best to be eaten that way. After sprouting they can be eaten raw or blanched for a short duration. The second best way to eat them is cooked.
To conclude, comparing nutrients in raw and cooked vegetables is not easy as there are trade offs involved. Given what we know, the best approach is to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, beans, grains, nuts and seeds and eat them in a variety of ways. This ensures that youâ€™re getting a mix of nutrients delivered by various methods of preparation.
