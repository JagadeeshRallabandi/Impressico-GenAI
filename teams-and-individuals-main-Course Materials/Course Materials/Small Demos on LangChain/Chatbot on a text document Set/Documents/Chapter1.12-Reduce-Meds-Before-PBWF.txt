1.12 REDUCE MEDS BEFORE PBWF
Those who are taking insulin or diabetic medications may need to reduce their medications or insulin once on PBWF diet and specially juice fast. Dr. McDougall asks all his Type-2 diabetes patients who attend his 10 day live-in clinic, to stop all medications and insulin on day one. PBWF diet and/or juice fast reduces your blood sugar and if you do not reduce insulin or medication, you can get hypoglycemic which is dangerous. Naturally these medications are taken to reduce blood from high to normal. If your sugar has already come down these medications will make you very low in sugar. Those who are not on any insulin or medication do not face this risk. Your body on its own will not allow sugar to go too low. 
We will discuss diabetes in detail next month.
