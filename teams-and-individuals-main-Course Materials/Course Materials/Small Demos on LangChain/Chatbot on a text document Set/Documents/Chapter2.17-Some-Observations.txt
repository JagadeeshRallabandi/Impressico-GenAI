2.17 SOME OBSERVATIONS 
Based on my experience in several health groups, I want to share four observations:
1. Somethings are easier said than done. Eating green leafy vegetables and not eating oil/ghee is one such advice. The only way we Indians know how to eat green leafy vegetables is by making saag which cannot be made without ghee. 
2. It is often difficult to give up our favorite foods even after we have learned that they are unhealthy. It is lot easier to add foods and specially foods that are tasty. When we add healthy food it crowds out the unhealthy food.
3. When we make changes slowly the improvements are not noticeable and one often looses confidence. So it helps to make some changes which are dramatic and remain in our conscious mind. 
4. One conscious change often leads to many unconscious changes and benefits accrue. To give you one example, once I started walking for an hour every day I started rejecting caloric dense food like cookies and donuts because I was conscious that it would wash off my one hour worth of effort. 
Before we move on to the subject of ‚Äú How to Eat‚Äù,   I request all to watch a documentary ‚ÄúFat Sick and Nearly Dead‚Äù. This is available on Netflix. 
The second documentary is available on Utube and linked below. üëá
