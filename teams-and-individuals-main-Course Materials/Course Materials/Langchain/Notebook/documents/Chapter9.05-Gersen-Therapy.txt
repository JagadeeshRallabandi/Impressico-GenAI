9.5 GERSEN THERAPY
In the early 1900s in Germany the Nobel-prize (1931) winning Dr. Otto Warburg, suggested that cancer cells â€œlive in hypoxic, very low oxygen, and acidic conditions and derive energy from sugars by fermenting them the way yeast does. From this, he theorized that these low-oxygen and highly-acidic conditions caused cancer. At the same time his contemporary Dr. Gersen was beginning to treat cancer patients using an unconventional method of flooding body with nutrients using green juicing and detoxing liver by giving organic coffee enema. Dr. Gersen in 1936 moved to U.S. and started treating cancer patients using his therapy. 
He may have had some Indian influence. Germans have had interest in Indian philosophy and Ayurveda for several centuries. 
In US initially he was highly acclaimed but later they started calling him a quack and banned his practice. He wrote a book outlining 50 case histories of curing cancer. His daughter Charlotte opened a clinic in Mexico just south of the SanDiego border, as it is banned in US. The clinic has had a significant success rate considering that only last stage cancer patients go there. I am posting some links to several documentaries made on him. His main premise is that human body heals itself. All we need to do is to feed it nutrients and keep it detoxified. The documentaries are worth watching. ðŸ‘‡
