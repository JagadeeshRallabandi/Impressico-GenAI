9.6 OMAD Fast for Cancer Patients
Many doctors advise patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation to consume extra protein diets and eat eggs, dairy or chicken soup etc. This advise is in conflict with the research on immunotherapy by the Nobel laureates Dr. Tasuku Honzo and James Allison, and work by Dr. Valter Longo of USCâ€™s Longevity Center. 
I recommend that all cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment, should follow advice of these scientists and practice Navratri style OMAD (one meal a day) fast for five days each month. The meal should be under 500 calories and low protein (under 5%). Please refer to my post on Navratri Fast.
