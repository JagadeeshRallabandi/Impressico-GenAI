6.11 ANCEL KEY’S  7-COUNTRY STUDY
Ancel Keys was a famous American physiologist who had formulated a balanced meal for combat soldiers called K-rations during second World War.
Ancel Keys hypothesized that dietary saturated fat causes heart attack. He had presented this diet-lipid-heart disease hypothesis in 1955 to the World Health Organization (WHO). He undertook a study popularly known as “Seven Country Study” which proved his hypothesis and it became the basis of US government’s recommendation to reduce fat consumption. This is what led to the proliferation of low fat foods beginning in 1960s. After his death in 2004 the data discovered from his house and lab showed that the the study was actually conducted in 22 countries and he had eliminated 15 countries to manipulate the data to prove his hypothesis. It is probably the biggest lie of the 20th sanctuary. It shows how researchers can stoop so low (to prove their hypothesis) for fame and money. His picture was printed on the cover of the TIME magazine.
