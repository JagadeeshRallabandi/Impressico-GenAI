2.48 Almonds: Skinned or Not ?
One of the most debated questions in my groups is whether one should eat almonds with skin or without skin. This is one of the most frivolous question debated specially in India because Ayurveda recommends removing skin. Also in India almonds are valued more than walnuts or pecans which actually are healthier than almonds. I come across many members who have been eating five soaked and pealed almonds first thing in the morning and some feel offended when I advise against that due to intermittent fasting benefits. 
Almond skin has tannin which is difficult to digest. Soaking them helps removes the skin. Also washing removes any surface impurities that might have accumulated during processing and transportation. In US these processes are automated and there is no contamination. 
Almond skins are not without their benefits. They are rich in polyphenols which have antioxidant properties and also rich in prebiotic fiber which is good for the Microbiota in your gut. In my opinion it is a washout. Eat almonds which ever way you like. Some dishes call for skinned almonds and some donâ€™t. 
If you are soaking them, you should definitely throw away the water and not drink it.
