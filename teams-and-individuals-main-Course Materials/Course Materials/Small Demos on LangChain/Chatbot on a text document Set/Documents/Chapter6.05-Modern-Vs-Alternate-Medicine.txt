6.5 MODERN VS ALTERNATE MEDICINE
The fact that human body is self healing may not have been as well understood as we know now. As a result beneficial results of different forms of medicines and treatments were often credited to the type of medicine and treatment as opposed realizing that this may be due to placebo effect.  This led to many theories, and many different forms of treatments evolved. Today, we (the so called educated people) call these unconventional forms of treatment as Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) (Complimentary word was added much later). Traditional alternative medicine  include:
* Acupuncture
* Ayurveda
* Chiropractic
* Homeopathy
* Hydrotheraphy
* Magnetic Therapy
* Naturopathy
* Yunani Medicine
* Chinese & Oriental medicine.
* Gem Therapy
* Spiritual: Tabiz and Vibhuti
I am sure there are many more that can be added to this list. 
All these therapies were commonly practiced in different parts of the world till the turn of the 20th century. So the question one may ask is, when did these therapies become alternate?
In America at the time, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie were the two richest men. Rockefeller had monopoly in oil business controlling 90% of it and Carnegie in steel business. Both were active in many charitable causes. In 1908 they proposed to American Medical Association (AMA) and the US government that it would be nice to study the state of educatio in health care, various health care practices prevalent at the time, and formalize and standardize the medical education. It seemed like a noble cause. Mr. Carnegie hired a bright educator named Abraham Flexner and assigned him the task. (Abraham was a brother of Simon Flexner who worked at the time for Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.) 
After spending over a year and traveling throughout the US and Canada, Abraham Flexner submitted a book length report in 1910 titled “Medical Education in U.S. and Canada”, commonly called “The Flexner Report”.
The report suggested closing all 2 year diploma programs and standardizing on a 4 year program, curriculum for which was also established. Surprisingly this curriculum did not include a single course in nutrition, considering that herbal medicine accounted for half of all medicine at the time. 
The US government adopted these recommendations and the medicine as we know now evolved.
The result was banning of all alternate treatment practices unless practiced by an MD doctor. Small medical schools were either closed or merged into universities which were financially supported by large business houses. In less than 10 years the number of medical colleges dropped from 650 to 50 and the number of medical students decreased from 7,500 to 2,500. Many forms of alternate practices were classified as quackery and banned. 
The doctors were taught medicine for 4 years and only they were allowed to prescribe medication, that also after obtaining a license to practice medicine.  
Abraham Flexner was later made the first director of the Rockefeller philanthropy programs in medical education. 
In 1928 the first antibiotic, Penicillin was developed and it became a magic cure-all for the infectious diseases which were most prevalent at the time. Discovery of vitamins also happened during this period. 
Within a few decades a psyche evolved that if you are ill go see a doctor he will prescribe you a pill and you will be fine. 
In this story what I have not told you so far is the fact that Rockefeller and Carnegie were some of the largest drug producers at the time Flexner Report was produced. As a result of these changes, their business boomed. They were also the contributors to many medical colleges and sat on the governing boards of these medical colleges.

PS: 
Couple of footnotes to this post:
1. When Dr. Collin Campbell made the documentary “Forks over Knives” his course in nutrition (the most popular course at Cornell) was cancelled. 
2. Dr. McDougall and other PBWF doctors have been urging to introduce a single course in nutrition in the medical program but AMA has vehemently opposed it. As a result there is still no course in the 4 year medical program.
