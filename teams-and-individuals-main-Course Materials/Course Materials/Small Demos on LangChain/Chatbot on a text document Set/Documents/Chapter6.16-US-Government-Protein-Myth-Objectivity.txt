6.16 US Government, Protein Myth and Objectivity in Nutritional Research
Following are quotes from a paper written by UC Berkeley’s Nutrition science professor Kenneth J. Carpenter,  titled “The History of Enthusiasm for Protein”.
“In the 1890s USDA recommended over 110 grams of dietary protein per day for working men. This was based on Liebig’s idea that protein was the source of muscular energy and the observation that protein consumption was higher in the more successful (i.e. affluent) social groups or nations than elsewhere.”
“After the 1939-45 war dry skim milk became available in the USA as a “fortune by-product of a domestic surplus-product problem”. It was clearly more satisfactory in every respect to dump it in the developing countries than to have to burry it in the US, as was contemplated by the Department of Agriculture at one point.”
India definitely got it’s share of this milk powder as I am myself witness to that. The program was called “Food for Peace” and later became known as USAID PL-480. 
A non profit eye hospital my father headed received it’s share of such aid. I mention this only to emphasize how mistaken the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) was at the time and how it played a role in propagating the protein myth. 110 grams of protein is triple of what we now know to be the true requirement of protein. The following video by Dr. Greger puts it in an interesting perspective. It also highlights how scientists loose objectivity in their passionate pursuit of research grants and professional success. The subject I cover in great detail in the posts during fourth week of the course in the health groups.
In a paper written by Professor J. P. Rivers of Departmentof Human Nutrition, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, he says:
“The dispassionate objectivity of scientists is a myth. No scientist is simply involved in the single-minded pursuit of truth, he is also engaged in the passionate pursuit of research grants and professional success.”
