9.3 CANCER TREATMENT 
Now let us focus on what can we do if we or a loved one is diagnosed with cancer. 
The common medical practice of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation should be followed. In addition one needs to focus on the diet. 
ANGEOGENIC FOODS
Clearly one needs to eliminate all angiogenic foods from the diet. These include following:
1. Milk and milk products
2. All animal foods including fish and eggs
3. Refined sugar
4. Refined Oils
5. Processed prepackaged foods
ANTI ANGEOGENIC FOODS
Foods that should be added to diet are the ones which have strong anti angiogenic properties. Some of these are listed below: 
1. Allium Vegetables like Garlic, Onions and Leak 
2. Cruciferous Vegetables like Broccoli, Cabbage,Kale
3. Ginger
4.Turmeric 
5. Chili Peppers
6. Flaxseed
7. Lemon
8. Berries of all colors
9. Cranberries
10. Apple Peals
11. Green Tea
12. Pomegranate 
13. Figs
14. Cinnamon
15. Green mangoes 
Significant research has been done on affect of various foods on different cancers. I am posting some videos below that show how research has shown some foods to be beneficial for certain types of cancers. I am posting them not to isolate certain foods over other, you all know my views about that subject well, “Foods that are healthy help in all chronic diseases and the ones which are unhealthy hurt in all chronic diseases”. The videos are only to further solidify your conviction and motivate you to make changes towards PBWFood. To assume that foods that were not tested may not be helpful to cure cancer would be flawed.
