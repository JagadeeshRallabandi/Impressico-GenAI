8.1 DIABETES TYPE-1
Diabetes type-1 is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. It typically appears in adolescence. The only treatment known today is to take insulin daily. 
Type-1  Diabetes is believed to be caused by an auto immune reaction, that destroys beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. 
An auto immune disease is where the immune cells produced by the body to fight a perceived external threat (from the presence of foreign protein cells), attack the healthy body cells simply because they are too close in resemblance to the foreign protein cells. There is a strong correlation between cowâ€™s milk consumption in childhood to onset of Type-1 diabetes. 
This process can go on for months or years before any symptoms appear.
The research has shown that people who go on Plant Based Whole Food diet can benefit by reducing the intake of insulin required. 
There are some claims of curing this disease by consuming only raw PBWF. Amongst the doctors making such claims is Dr. Gabriel Cousins of Arizona. I am not aware of any double blind study demonstrating such success. It is for this reason I hesitate to post any videos by Dr. Gabriel Cousins. But you may want to look them up. The short video linked below describes Type-1 diabetes well. ðŸ‘‡
