4.5 HOW  MUCH  WALKING?
There are many factors where the benefits lie on a continuum but to make a point it helps to pick a number. Walking is one such factor. It is fairly well established that more you walk each day the better it is for health. Of course the extreme excess of everything is bad. It is always the law of diminishing returns. The research has shown that one hour walking per day is better than half hour walking per day which is better than 20 minutes each day and even that is better than no walking at all. The research has also shown that one and a half hour walking each day is better than one hour each day. There is no research beyond that. In one and a half hour one covers about 10,000 steps. Separately research has also shown that walking five minutes each waking hour is a good target for activity level. Considering seven hours of sleep time that comes to 85 minutes (17x5). So I recommend five minutes of walking each waking hour. It is a good idea to split that walk into multiple sessions. The study of various Blue Zones around the world where people live the longest disease free life has also shown that the average number of daily steps people walk there is over 13,000. I personally shoot for a goal of 100,000 per week and minimum 10,000 per day (extra on the weekends). Doing less would be shortchanging yourself. This is just a marker to be used as a guide. Playing tennis or badminton or biking or swimming are other options. The target should be one and a half hour of activity per day. The attached video by Dr. Greger discusses some research behind it. ðŸ‘‡
