7.10 ATRIAL  FIBRILLATION 
There is a common misconception among many young people (under 50) who are not overweight and who exercise regularly, that they are fit and healthy. Many people in there 40s become health conscious and are misguided to low carb diets. (A movement heavily supported by the meat and dairy industry). So I am talking about a person who is in his or her 40s eating high protein high fat, low carb diet (keto diet) and very active and regular with gym. It gives them a misplaced sense of wellness. Higher level of physical activity successfully delays the negative consequences of high animal protein and high saturate fat diet and masks the problems developing in their cardiovascular system. If they also happen to be consuming alcohol, (fortunately smoking is less common now), which often is the case, there is this feeling that “I am fit and healthy because I workout regularly in the gym and I am staying away from carbs.”
Physical activity can mask many diet deficiencies only up to a point and accumulation of body’s compensatory responses does catch up sooner or later. A common outcome is a heart event that may or may not bring to attention the heart problems. This could be any of the following:
1. Silent Myocardial Infarction (SMI). These account for 45% of all heart attacks. 
2. Coronary Artery Disease
3. Heart Valve Disease
4. Arrhythmia
5. Minor stroke
These are all serious diseases but often without any noticeable symptoms. In this post, I want to talk about one such disease called Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).
AFib is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase your risk of strokes, heart failure and other heart-related complications including death. During AFib the heart's two upper chambers (the atria) beat chaotically and irregularly — out of coordination with the two lower chambers (the ventricles). AFib is the most common form of Arrhythmia and effects over 2.5 million people in the US.
* AFib symptoms are often unnoticeable. They can vary from feeling light-headed, dizzy or short of breadth to feeling tired or fatigued. Some experience chest pain or palpitations. 
* Episodes of AFib may come and go, or one may develop AFib that doesn't go away and may require treatment. Although AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening, it is a serious medical condition that sometimes requires emergency treatment.
* A major concern with AFib is the potential to develop blood clots within the upper chambers of the heart. These blood clots may circulate to other organs and lead to blocked blood flow (ischemia).
* When the clot travels with the blood to the brain, it causing a stroke. AFib patients are five times more likely to have a stroke. It is for this reason AFib patients are prescribed blood thinners. 
* In a normal heart, a Sino atrium (SA) node in the atrium releases an electrical signal that makes the atria and ventricle function in synchronized way to pump blood throughout the body. 
* In AFib the atrias beat faster and in an irregular fashion (quiver rather than contract) making heart’s rhythm irregular. This happens often because the electrical signal originate at the wrong place. 
* Electro Cardiogram (EKG) is the best way to detect AFib.  
* AFib is a progressive disease and it has three stages: (1)Paroxysmal AFib (2)Persistent AFib and (3)Permanent AFib
* AFib, if untreated tends to change the shape of the heart through a process called remodeling. The heart increases in size as it has to work much harder and it’s tissues get damaged. 
TREATMENT:
* AFib treatment requires a three pronged approach: (1)Rate control (2)Rhythm maintenance and (3)Stroke Prevention
* Treatments for AFib may include medications and other interventions to try to alter the heart's electrical system.
* If medication does not help, there are other invasive procedures like Cardioversion, Catheter or Surgical Ablation and atrial Pacemaker
* AFib is a progressive disease and early dietary intervention is the best approach to handle it. 
CAUSES:
When you search for causes of AFib, you get flooded with a list like the following:
* Age: With age atrial tissues become weak and diseased
* High BP
* Enlarged atria which can be due to high BP or lung disease or prior AFib history
* Hormonal abnormality
* Alcohol abuse
* Smoking
* Family History 
* Obesity
* Sleep Apnea
* Heart valve Failure
* Diabetes
* Coronary Artery Disease
They all very conveniently skirt the issue of diet which causes all these conditions to begin with. Some thing I have repeatedly discussed in the section dealing with the politics of food and health care. The documentary “What the Health” also covers it well. 
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:
The innermost lining of the whole cardiovascular system is made of endothelial cells and collectively called endothelium. These cells release nitric oxide (NO) gas molecules which play three major functions:
1. Nitric Oxide makes the blood flow very smooth. 
2. Nitric Oxide is the strongest blood vessel dilator in the body. 
3. Nitric Oxide also restricts the artery from becoming thickened and stiffer. This protects us from getting high BP and Hypertension. 
Consumption of inflammatory foods damages endothelial cells and, as a repair mechanism, fatty deposits, called plaque, build up on the walls called atherosclerosis. These deposits are made up of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium and fibrin (a clotting material in the blood).
Atherosclerosis impacts endothelial cells ability to release nitric oxide gas which affects the blood flow and the malleability of the muscles. The arteries become harder and so do the muscles of the heart. This affects there smooth functioning. 
Consumption of foods rich in nitrates provide the nitric oxide necessary for smooth functioning of the endothelium and the whole cardio vascular system. Foods richest in nitrates are green leafy vegetables and beetroots. Consumption of these foods, (often neglected by the younger generation), protects us from plaque development and also helps reverse the plaque. 
Other Dietary Concerns:
Electrolytes like magnesium and potassium are necessary for the smooth functioning of the body and it’s electrical signaling functions. A diet deficient in green leafy vegetables can lead to magnesium and potassium deficiency. One must also avoid any calcium supplements as they block absorption of magnesium. Calcium is also implicated in plaque formation and hardening of the cardio vascular muscles. 
In our modern lifestyle where most of the jobs involve indoor office work many people develop vitamin D-3 deficiency, which can also reduce magnesium absorption. 
The plant based whole food diet and physically active, intermittent fasting lifestyle should help one stop progression of AFib and relieve the risk of stroke.
