2.7 FIBER AS NUTRIENT
Fiber as an important nutrient was recognized much later than most other nutrients. Dr. Burkitt was the first to emphasize it‚Äôs importance in a book titled ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Forget Fiber in Your Diet‚Äù published in 1979.
For many years fiber was thought only to improve your bowl movement and satiety. Both of which are true but latest research has brought many more important benefits to our attention. 
There are two types of fiber; soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber dissolves in water, and includes plant pectin and gums. Insoluble fiber doesn‚Äôt dissolve in water. It includes plant cellulose and hemicellulose. Insoluble fiber attracts water into your stool, making it softer and easier to pass with less strain on your bowel. Insoluble fiber can help promote bowel health and regularity
Foods rich in Soluble fiber:
* Oatmeal and Barley 
* Beans,
* Blueberries, strawberries 
* Citrus fruits
* Apples and Pears
* Avocados
* Brussels Sprouts
* Potatoes and sweet potatoes
Foods rich in insoluble fiber:
* Wheat
* Corn
* Leafy vegetables 
* Beans, pulses and lentils
* Nuts & Seeds 
* Leafy vegetables 
* Celery and cucumber 
* Broccoli 
* Root vegetables
The microbes in our gut microbiome feed on soluble fiber to produce metabolites which help protect us from high BP and in many other ways. Active research is on going in this field. 
Soluble fiber helps reduce blood glucose levels and thereby reduces the risk of diabetes. Some of the other  benefits are:
*control body weight
* control and possibly prevent hypertension
* help balance cholesterol levels in blood
* regulate bowel movements and prevent hemorrhoids
* regulate your body‚Äôs satiation signals, which let you know when you‚Äôre full
* lower risk of colon cancer
* lower risk of breast cancer
* require more chewing, which slows down your meals and aids digestion.
