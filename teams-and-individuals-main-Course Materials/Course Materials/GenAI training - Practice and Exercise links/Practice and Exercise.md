|2|LLM Basics|[2023 Oct A Comprehensive Overview of Large Language Models.pdf](https://git.impressicocrm.com/impressico-ai-mgmt/impressico-general/teams-and-individuals/-/blob/main/Course%20Materials/2023%20Oct%20A%20Comprehensive%20Overview%20of%20Large%20Language%20Models.pdf?ref_type=heads)|"As a follow-up to our session today, do explore this pdf from the course materials folder .  Specifically, pay attention to 1) Fig 1 2) section II, sub-section K (pre-training objectives) 3) Table III (focus on columns ""No. of Params"" and ""Data/Tokens"".  ""Data/ Tokens"" is the size of the pre-training data expressed in data size or token count.  Now, compare GPT-3 and LLaMa-2.  clearly, LLaMa-2 being less than half the size of GPT-3 has been trained on a vastly greater amount of training data.  Meta did a really good job here and we have experienced in our customer-facing POCs that LLaMa-2's performance is equal at the very least to GPT-3)"|

|5|word2vec and gensim|[Gensim: Topic modelling for humans](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html)|"Folks, please install and play with GenSim - it's a open-source python lib and a collection of models for NLP and text .  specifically, go to Documentation -> Core Tutorials and practice the four tutorials within that. while it's not clear if we will use GenSim in any of our work, it's easily a very popular model and lib for working with text and is a good practice for how to vectorize (gen embeddings) text and derive several good use cases out of it"|

Do the above over today and tomorrow . After that Ashlesha will conduct a session that will build over these sessions.  So it's important that you finish all four of the above before our next session. 1. [LangChain Templates](https://blog.langchain.dev/langserve-hub/) 2.
