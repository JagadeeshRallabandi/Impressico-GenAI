8.5 DAWN PHENOMENA
Many doctors use fasting sugar level as the criteria to diagnose diabetes. Till late 1990s the cutoff point used to be 140. Then it was reduced to 120 which almost doubled the number of diabetics overnight. This is a very misleading test because there are many other reasons for blood sugar level to rise in the morning and this phenomenon is commonly called  “The Dawn Phenomenon”.
Easy explanation is that our body’s circadian clock prepares us by releasing certain hormones (Cortisol, Glucagon, Adrenal and Growth hormones) to face the work load of the morning. These help release glycogen from the liver and increase blood sugar level from a low of 70-80 at 4-5 AM to 120-160 by 8:00 AM. 
This phenomenon has not been researched enough and opinions do vary. Some attribute it to consumption of refined carbs at night. Others recommend a light carb snack at night and some recommend a keto diet. Doctors I follow do not support any of those recommendations. 
My recommendation is to not eat any thing after early dinner and stick to your intermittent fasting regimen. Just stop worrying about fasting sugar level. Get a Continuous Glucose Meter and monitor your daily graph and average glucose level. If your daily average is below 180 do not take medications to lower blood sugar and control only by sticking to PBWF diet and walking 10,000 steps daily or some other exercise equivalent.
Why are my morning fasting blood sugar levels high?
