7.12 TRIGLYCERIDES
Triglycerides are fat in your blood. High triglycerides are caused by high caloric diet. This fat is usually the fat in transit and it can be a result of any of the following:
1. Your previous meal had fat in it and it is more than what you can use as energy so it is being transported to your fat cells to be deposited. 
2. Your previous meal had too many calories which canâ€™t be used, so the liver converts extra calories, which were in the form of protein or sugar, into triglycerides and the blood is transporting them to the fat cells to be stored for future use during periods of famine or fasting, when there might be shortage of food. 
3. During periods of famine or fasting the blood extracts triglycerides from fat cells to be converted into (1) glycerol and fatty acids to be used as energy (2) sugar (glucose) and Ketone bodies (a form of energy for the brain) needed to run the body. 
When we eliminate animal food, oil/ghee and refined sugar from our diet the triglycerides level drops very quickly.
The healthy level of triglycerides is under 150mg/dL. 
I doubt, anyone in this group, who has been following PBWF/IF diet would have triglycerides any higher. Usually, Triglycerides level drops within the first few weeks.
Triglyceride level in itself is not a good marker. If a perfectly healthy lean person overeats for a week his triglyceride level will shoot up. 
However if an unhealthy person with high level of atherosclerosis eats oil and cholesterol rich food, it can trigger heart attack.
A single heavy meal can trigger a heart attack.
