2.5 Nutrients We Need 
Human body needs nutrients to survive. Besides water all nutrients can be subdivided into two groups: 
1.Macronutrients: These provide energy. There are three macronutrients:
- Proteins: 1gm = 4 calories 
- Carbohydrates: 1gm = 4 cal. 
- Fats: 1gm = 9 cal.
2.Micronutrients: Theses do not provide energy but are essential  to human body. These include:
- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Fiber
- Antioxidants
- Phytochemicals
Proteins are chains of amino acids. Certain amino acids can not be made by the body and must be consumed and that is why they are called essential amino acids. The protein we consume is first broken down to amino acids and different cells of the body use these amino acids to make new proteins each day. Human body is good in making proteins and it makes all the different protein (over 2 million) it needs from the various amino acids. All essential amino acids are made only by plants and move up the food chain. 
Similar to proteins human body is good at making fats (fatty acids). In fact all excess energy, whether it was consumed as fat, protein or carbs, is converted into fat in our liver and stored in our fat cells throughout the body but specially around the belly. The number of fat cells after adulthood do not change, only the amount of fat in each cell changes as one gains or looses weight. The only fats our body can not make are Omega fats and therefore they need to be consumed daily. Of various Omega fats Omega-3 is only available in limited amounts and therefore requires special attention. Human body needs Omega-3 and Omega-6 in equal amounts but in nature Omega-6 is available in plentiful but Omega-3 is not. Human body has preference in absorbing Omega-3 as a result some variance can be accommodated.  The disproportionate consumption of Omega-6 over Omega-3 is believed to be the cause of many  chronic illnesses. It is recommended that this ratio should be in 2-3 range. Most vegetable oils have this ratio in 1,000 to 100,000 range. Among cooking oils (as opposed to non cooking oils like olive, flaxseed, walnut), Mustard oil is one exception where this ratio is under 3. Ghee also has a good ratio but the amounts are lot less. 
Among Vitamins, most are available in plenty in plant based food however there are two that require special attention:
•Vitamin B-12 is found in nature in soil. It is in natural streams and rivers and well water. When  we work with dirt with our hands and legs or walk bare feet the body absorbs it. As we have moved away from such activities and chlorinated our municipal water, all natural sources have been blocked. That is why this is the only food supplement that pbwf doctors recommend. 
•Vitamin D-3 is made by human body under sunshine. As we have reduced venturing out in the sun some people face deficiency in this vitamin by the time they reach their 40s. If you are deficient and you do not spend some time in the sun, you will need to take supplement. Vitamin D from sunshine is healthier than supplements, because of the way they are processed in body.
There is evidence that vitamin-D supplement can exacerbate the bone problems instead of curing them.
FIBER: 
Fiber should be of concern to those who are eating diets rich in oil, sugar and dairy or animal food. None of these foods have any fiber. US fiber guidelines are less than half of what an average African native eats and even then 97% Americans fall short. Do not think we Indians get enough fiber simply because we eat daal, roti, rice. Typical Indian gets half of his calories from ghee, oil sugar and dairy. We will discuss it next. 
WATER:
Even though water has no calories or micronutrients, it plays a very important role in our daily consumption of nutrients. We will discuss it separately.
