2.51 Why No Processed Food
Human palate is capable of distinguishing six different tastes that are found in our diet: 
* Sweet, 
* Sour, 
* Salty, 
* Pungent (spicy), 
* Bitter, 
* Astringent. 
Our taste buds not only identify the tastes, they also signal our glands to release hormones to unlock the nutritional value of foods and kick-start the digestion process. 
For each of these tastes there is bell like gratification curve. The point at which the gratification is optimum is called the Bliss point. 
Of these tastes sugar is most rewarding as it releases dopamine which is a reward mechanism of the brain. We humans evolved this way to seek high caloric food. 
The bliss point of foods can be increased by adding other flavors. Most of us who have tried making lemonade know this because as we add lemon to sugary water we desire more sugar. 
Processed Food companies know this science very well and they hire PhDs in psychology to help stretch the bliss point for various foods they manufacture. Their goal is to sell more of the food and would like nothing better. This makes it difficult for you to eat in moderation only. Once you taste it, you want to eat more and more of it. 
Among food, sugar is the most addictive and increasing it’s consumption by increasing its bliss point (by tinkering with other flavors) is something these PhDs are experts in. 
The two examples I want to give are:
 (1) Coke: where you can consume 10 teaspoons of sugar in 12 oz. can. If you make 12 oz. lemonade at home you can’t add more than 5 teaspoons of sugar without spoiling the taste. 
(2) Potato chips that you make at home, you can’t eat beyond 2 oz. without feeling satiated but when it comes to Pringle brand you can finish 6 oz. and still want more. 
This is the most important reason to avoid processed food. It is best not to buy such foods. Other reasons include the preservatives and other additives which are not good for health but get approved as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) like vegetable shortening or other butter concoctions used in popcorn machines in movie halls. 
If you occasionally want to eat such foods, make sure you make them at home. 
The two good books to read on this subject are “Salt, Sugar, Fat” and “Hooked” by Michael Moss. Michael has dedicated his life to researching this subject.
