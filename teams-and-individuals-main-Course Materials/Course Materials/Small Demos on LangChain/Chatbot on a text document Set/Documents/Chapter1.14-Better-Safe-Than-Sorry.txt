1.14 BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY
What does this mean to you?
I had discussed various food myths during the first week of this group. One myth I forgot was the myth about “better safe than sorry”. 
Most people believe that it is safer to continue taking some medications but to experience an occasional elevated BP or blood sugar or blood cholesterol, is sorry. 
WHAT IF THE REVERSE WAS TRUE?
All the documentation I have provided so far and specially last week about the politics of PHARMA, FOOD and HEALTH CARE industry and the GOVERNMENT and MEDIA, is to the contrary. 
This thinking is flawed and the posts of last week were focused to communicate this point. Please make sure you see those videos. For those who are not on any medications skipping those videos may be okay as long as you catch up later. But for those who are on medications for chronic conditions, it is important to watch the videos. 
Human body is very smart and knows how to cope with the diet and lifestyle, it is subjected to. These raised levels of BP or blood sugar or cholesterol are result of body’s comypensatory response. 
What body does not know is how to deal with those synthetic medications. They are foreign to the body and interfere with body’s compensatory mechanisms. Besides they have to be processed by the liver and the kidney and strain them in ways not fully understood. 
So if you want to “be safe than sorry”, then you are better off letting the body do it’s job and raise those markers as and when necessary, while you focus on correcting the diet and lifestyle.
