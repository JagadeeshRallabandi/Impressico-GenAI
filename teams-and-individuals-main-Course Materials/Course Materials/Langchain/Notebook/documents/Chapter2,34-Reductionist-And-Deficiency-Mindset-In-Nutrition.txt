2.34 Reductionist & Deficiency Mindset in Nutrition 
Creating and propagating a reductionist and deficiency mindset serves the purpose of the Processed Food and Supplements industry well.
The nutrition science has focused on these two approaches for the past several decades and in spite of the wealth of academic knowledge on nutrition and chronic diseases one does not see any dent in the growth in such diseases. It makes one wonder, why is it so. One explanation is that field of nutrition has become more about marketing profitable products than educating people about fundamentals of health and wellness. 
After having explained the role of nutrients, I want to emphasize that one must unlearn everything and only remember that 
“Food not Nutrients, is the fundamental Unit in Nutrition”.
