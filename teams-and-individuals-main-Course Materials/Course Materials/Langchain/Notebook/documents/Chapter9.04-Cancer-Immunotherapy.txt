9.4 CANCER  IMMUNOTHERAPY 
Besides chemotherapy and radiation there is another approach to treating cancer called Cancer Immunotherapy. 
It treats cancer patients using components of the immune system. It involves antibodies that bind to, and inhibit the function of, proteins expressed by cancer cells. Cancer immunotherapies include vaccines and T cell infusions. Immunotherapy can be done in two ways:
1. Stimulating or boosting the natural defense of one’s own body so it works harder and smarter to find and kill cancer cells.
2. Making cells in a lab that are just like immune cells and injecting them in the body to improve one’s immune system. 
Some recent research, recognized by the two Nobel prizes in physiology (2016 and 2018) has led to new approaches in treating cancer. The research shows that prolonged fasting can reset Autoimmunity and Rejuvenating Systems to help fight cancer. 
Dr. Valter Longo who is director of Longevity Institute at University of Southern California has developed a fast mimicking diet (FMD) (for those who are unable to keep prolonged fasts) that helps an individual’s immune system in fighting cancer. 
Medical science has known for some time that prolonged fasting can be a cure of last resort. There is a TrueNorth Health Center in Santa Rosa California where seriously ill patients are treated by putting them through prolonged fasting (up to a maximum of 40 days water fasts) under supervision. 
Cancer patients may benefit significantly by doing prolonged fasting for five days every month or every other month.
