9.2 CANCER PROGRESSION
Cancer progression starts when cancer cells floating in our body fluids attach to a pat of the body and blood vessels are formed in them. This process is called Angiogenesis. When  the blood vessels are formed the cancer cells begin to get food supply to grow and multiply and the tumor develops. Once it has grown enough to be detected we call it cancer. The process of angiogenesis is promoted by IGF-1 (Insulin like Growth Factor-1) hormone which is abundant in animal protein. Dr. Collin Campbell has demonstrated that if you eliminate all animal protein in your diet and add fruits and vegetables, you can make yourself almost cancer proof.
I want to clarify here that
Indians are not vegans. They consume lot of milk products. Casein, the protein in milk causes angiogenesis. In fact it was a paper by two Hyderabad researchers (T.V.Madhavan and C. Gopalan) in 1968 which demonstrated that mice that were fed 20% casein developed tumer when exposed to carcinogens but the group that was fed only 5% casein did not develop tumor in spite of same exposure to carcinogens. Dr. Collin Campbell in the documentary ‚ÄúForks Over Knives‚Äù talks about it at length. This paper changed the thinking of Dr. Collin Campbell entirely. He was heading Cornell‚Äôs department of Nutrition Sciences and had represented US in a major study of cancer patients in China known as the China Study. It is the largest study ever undertaken to understand the correlation between food and cancer.
Please watch the talk by Dr. Collin Campbell on how animal protein turns on cancer. 
Also please watch the Ted Talk video by Dr. William Lee who explains the phenomenon of Angiogenesis and how anti angiogenic food helps fight cancer.üëá
