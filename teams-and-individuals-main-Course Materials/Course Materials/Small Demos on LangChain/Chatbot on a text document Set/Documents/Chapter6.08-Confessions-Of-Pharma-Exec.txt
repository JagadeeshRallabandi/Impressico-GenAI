6.8 CONFESSIONS OF A PHARMA EXEC.
The consumption of medicines is not as benign as widely believed. All medications have side effects and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Drug companies try to get away from disclosing ADRs. 
The following video is by an Indiann executive of one of the largest drug company Eli  Lilly, Dr. John Virapen, who  dared to expose  the drug industry. Please watch the attached video below. 
Here are some quotes from the video. 
1. “They (Pharma industry) are not interested in curing any disease you may have. They more interested in making you get diseases. They are interested in symptomatic treatment. They want patients who are diabetics, cardiology patients, Parkinson’s disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Arterioses, because you live a long time and the drugs you have to take, you take that for the rest of your life.”
2. Few years ago, Eli Lilly was fined by a Pensilvania court 1.4 billion dollars for knowingly selling a schizophrenic drug Zyprexa  to elderly patients which made them sleepy and also diabetic. Eli Lilly is the largest producer of diabetic drugs in the world. 
3. “But it (the news of settlement) never came out, you know why, because the press, also works with the Pharma industry just like the Government does.”
4. “The Pharma company uses the media to implant it’s dirty work on you. You never get to know the truth until it is too late.  So you have to raise your awareness to a higher level. Don’t take for granted what you doctor is telling you because doctor is insane.”They don’t know much about the medicine and they don’t care much about the patient. They think about how much they can get paid and this is how the Pharma industry reigns, stays in power. They buy the doctors. The doctors don’t get their information from anywhere’s else except the Pharma industry and I know because when I was a salesman, the Pharma company used to tell me ; never talk side effects. They talk of something called FAB ; Features, Advantage, Benefits. Talk about side effects was a taboo. for I know that. I also know that they hide the dangers side effects because I was in charge of the critical trial for Prozac.”
5. Late US president Grorge zBush’s father was a Director of the Board of Eli Lilly. Also one of George Bushe’s advisor was a vice president of Eli Lilly. Rumsford was also a Vice President in the Pharma industry. 
Eli Lilly is one of the largest political contributor to the Republican Party. 
“ That ladies and gentlemen is the highest form of corruption. It is called lobbying.”👇
