6.18 OPIOID LAWSUIT 
As we are on the subject of Pharma Industry, I wanted to highlight the Opioid lawsuit, that just got settled last month and Pharma industry agreed to pay over 8 billion dollars. Of course they are so profitable that they consider such settlements as a nuisance and cost of doing business. It is also not clear if all the money would get collected. One company has already declared bankruptcy. Here is the link to the news, in case you missed it. ðŸ‘‡
