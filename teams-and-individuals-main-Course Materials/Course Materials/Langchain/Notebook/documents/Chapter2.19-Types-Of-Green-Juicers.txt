2.19 TYPES OF GREEN JUICERS
There are 4 types of vegetable Juicers:
1. Two step Hydraulic juicer. This was developed by Dr. Norwalk in 1930s for his friend Dr. Gersen who cured cancer patients by juice therapy (More on that later). This is the best juicer on the market and costs about $2,000. The original company that makes such juicers is Norwalk. Another company that makes such juicers is PURE.
2. Double Helical Screw type. The yield of these juicers is almost as good as the hydraulic juicers. There are only two manufacturer of this type that I am aware of.
- Angel $1400 +/-
- Green Star $500+/-
3. Slow speed single augur type. Many manufacturers. Hurom, Omega and Kuving are good names.  $200-400 +/-
4. High Speed Centrifugal as shown in the documentary “Fat Sick and Nearly Dead”. These are least effective in extracting juice from leafy vegetables and also the high speed oxidizes the nutrients. 
You can tell the quality of these juicers by measuring the moisture in the pulp that is thrown out. The videos I have attached compare many of these models. There are many more videos on the YouTube which may be worth watching. The yield from different juicers can vary by as much as twice. Considering that you buy juicer once and produce every day and your time is also valuable, you can recover the extra cost within a year. Specially in US, if you are paying a maid to come twice a week to take out juice, just the labor cost becomes about 100 dollars per week. Organic produce is also expensive.
