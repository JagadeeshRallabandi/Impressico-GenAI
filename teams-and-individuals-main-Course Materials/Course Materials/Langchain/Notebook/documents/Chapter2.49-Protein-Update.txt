2.49 PROTEIN UPDATE
I have maintained in this group  that diets rich in protein are unhealthy and cause unnecessary burden on liver and kidney. Human body can not store protein so excess protein has to be converted into fat by removing the nitrogen from it in the liver. Nitrogen combines with Hydrogen to make Ammonia  (NH3) which is very toxic and has to be converted into Uric Acid which is finally excreted as Urine. The process taxes both liver and kidney and is a leading cause of kidney failure in old age. 
There is a report published this week about research being done by Dr. Dudley Lamming of University of Washington at Madison, which throws interesting light on this subject of excessive protein consumption. The research, conducted on rodents, suggest that:
1. Diets high in protein BCAA (the three branched chain amino acids), are associated with diabetes, obesity and other metabolic illnesses. Conversely, diets low in BCAAs can counter these metabolic ailments and even extend the healthy lifespan.
2. Low-protein diets reprogram metabolism even when animals eat the same — or more — calories. 
3. “There’s a growing realization that a calorie is not just a calorie, that a calorie has implications beyond just its caloric content,” says Dr. Lamming. “What our research is showing is that protein calories are not the same as other calories.”
This study gives further credence to what we strongly believe in this group.👇
