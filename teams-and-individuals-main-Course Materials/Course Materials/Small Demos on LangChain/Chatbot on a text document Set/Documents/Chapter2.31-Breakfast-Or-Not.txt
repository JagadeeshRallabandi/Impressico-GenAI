2.31 BREAKFAST  OR  NOT 
Technically, breakfast is the first meal of the day no matter what time of the day you take it. But most of us believe it is the meal taken in the morning. 
Google search shows:
It was not until the 15th century that "breakfast" came into use in written English to describe a morning meal, which literally means to break the fasting period of the prior night; in Old English the term was morgenmete meaning "morning meal."
The quote “ Breakfast is the most important meal of the day” was first authored by Lenna Francis Cooper in the Good Health magazine, over 100 years ago in 1917. Lenna was a nurse and dietitian (one of the earliest, if not the first) and worked for John Harvey Kellog who developed the first breakfast cereal “Corn Flakes”. It was an attempt to sell and popularize Cornflakes. 
Today breakfast cereal is a big and most profitable business of the food industry. So this quote has become commonplace; thanks to the processed food industry. 
The current research is suggesting that breakfast, if taken early, is not the most important meal. In fact if one is suffering from any chronic diseases like Hyper Tension, Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome It is healthy to delay breakfast or combine it with lunch for a brunch thereby reducing the eating window. (See the post on intermittent fasting for more on this.)
Oatmeal is the ideal breakfast. I have posted my recipe separately. A glass of Green juice (or smoothie) followed by large serving of fruits and then some cereal like oatmeal or idly is ideal breakfast or brunch. Idly with chutney is always better than with sambhar (because most sambhar have oil).
