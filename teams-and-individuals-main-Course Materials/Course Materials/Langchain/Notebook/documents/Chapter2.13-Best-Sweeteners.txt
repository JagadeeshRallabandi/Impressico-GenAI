2.13 BEST SWEETENERS 
A big challenge in PBWF diet is how to replace sugar which we love and use in so many recipes. 
Sugar is in many natural fruits and vegetables and it is embedded in fibers. Sugar in natural form is what body needs. When we consume natural foods sugar is released slowly and the rate of release matches up, more or less, to the rate of expenditure of energy. As a result there is not much insulin required. The problem comes when sugar is refined all fiber has been removed. 
The best sugar to consume is date sugar as it is nothing but dried pulverized dates. One can also make date syringe sautÃ©ing dates and adding a little water. 
Other options are molasses, Jaggery  and honey. These options are not healthy in the absolute sense but they are less unhealthy than refined sugar or artificial sweeteners. Honey also releases sugar immediately as their is no fiber but honey specially local raw honey has some beneficial value as it has flavonoids and it can help reduce allergies from pollen. Buy honey at local farmers market and use sparingly. For those people who are otherwise healthy, meaning not on any chronic medication, I recommend two teaspoons of honey or jaggery or sugar per day.
Artificial sweeteners should not be used. Even refined sugar (as bad as it is) is less harmful than artificial sweeteners. It is covered under separate heading. 
Here is a good video on the subject of sweetener options. ðŸ‘‡
