7.13 LOW CARB: REALLY?
I received a post recently from a member, which went some thing like this:
Lalit Ji, after joining your group last month, I have reduced consuming carbs. 
I responded by saying: “if you have reduced your carbs, then you must have increased fat and protein in your diet which I have not advised in any of my posts.”
To that the she responded: 
“No I have not increased fats or protein”. 
Upon further query as to what her diet actually was she responded: 
I do 16 hours of fasting . Breakfast is oatmeal and lunch is Methi thepla or home
made chapati with some veggies or dal and after 3 hours some fruit, and dinner is similar but less chapati and more of veggies.
I eat Karela with every meal and it helps with my sugar control. 
In between I drink Methi, cummin seeds and fennel seed water on some days.”
What is interesting, about this exchange of dialogue, is that she is doing everything right but in her mind she is carrying this impression that she has cut down on carbs. 
There might be many in this group who may be carrying such  myths, so I decided to do some checking and here are the results showing the carb content as % of total calories of her meal items. 
Apple:                        95%
Romaine Lettuce:   70%
Cucumber                 83%
Tomatoes                  81%
Spinach:                    64%
Bitter Gourd              81%
Mung Daal:               74%
Whole wheat Roti:   81%
It was not my idea to demean her in any way. In fact I thank her for her query, as it led to this post 
which should clarify the confusion, many hold. I request all to be careful and in your naively do not propagate the myth that “this fellow named Lalit Kapoor has been advising us to eat low carb diets.”My post titled “Protein, Fat or Carbs” made it very clear that most of what we humans need to eat is carbs, however they need to be Plant Based Whole Foods.
