7.11 VIAGRA: The  Rest of the  Story
Few people know the story of Viagra so I thought I will devote a post to that. 
The discovery of nitric oxide's (NO) signaling role in the cardiovascular and nervous systems had been known since 1980s but its clinical use was only emerging at the turn of the millennium and UCLA pharmacologist Dr. Louis Igarro was on the forefront of it. He received a Nobel Prize in 1998 for his discoveries on how nitric oxide is important in opening up clogged blood vessels. 
Based on the work of Dr. Louis Igarro, Pfizer a leading pharmaceutical company in the world, was working on developing a new hypertension drug to treat high blood pressure and Angina. During the heart clinical trials, researchers discovered that the drug was more effective at inducing erections than treating angina. 
That led to the development of Viagra and now you know the rest of the story. 
It is estimated that roughly 30 million men in the U.S. and over 100 million men worldwide suffer from ED. A large U.S. survey determined about 50 percent of men 40 to 70 years of age experience some degree of ED.
What Viagra achieves for short duration is also achieved by consumption of green leafy vegetables and beetroots regularly and this change is long lasting.
